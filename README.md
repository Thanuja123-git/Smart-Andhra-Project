# Smart-Andhra-Project
The “Smart Andhra App” is used to help the people to register the problems in 
their locality in online instead of going to the nearby Government Organization. 
In this app people have to register with their phone number and have to register 
their complaints. After registering their complaints this app will display a page 
showing their registration is successful. 
The Government officials can login to this app with their registered email id and 
password and can see the list of complaints.
This app helps the people to save time by registering their complaints online 
instead of going to the government organizations in these tough covid times.
